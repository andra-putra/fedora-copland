# Tob-Fedora Rice/Theme

This repository contains my personal Fedora setup configurations, including GNOME settings, custom keyboard layouts, and various dotfiles.

Note: Forge is a tiling window manager-like extension for Gnome.

### Firefox Theme

Note: The orange ring surrounding firefox you see is the "selected window" indicator from Forge TWM extension mentioned earlier.

### Colors are based on an [Edex-UI Theme](https://github.com/GitSquared/edex-ui/blob/master/media/screenshot_blade.png)
